*BACKGROUND*
---

>An analysis of arrest data voluntarily reported to the FBI by thousands of city and county police departments around the country reveals that, in 800 jurisdictions, black people were arrested at a rate five times higher than white people in 2018, after accounting for the demographics of the cities and counties those police departments serve.

>In 250 jurisdictions, black people were 10 times more likely to be arrested than their white counterparts.

>The analysis, conducted by ABC News in collaboration with ABC-owned stations, covers a three-year period ending in 2018, from which the most recent data is available.

SMPD Publishes arrest lists daily (See: [SMPD Media Arrest List](https://www.sanmarcostx.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5913/SMPD-Media-Arrest-List--06-23-2020-PDF?bidId= "Data Goldmine!") & [SMPD Incident List](https://www.sanmarcostx.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5875/SMPD-Incident-Blotter-06-29-2020-pdf "This one is not as detailed")) These are very useful for basic demographic information that can answer my questions about black arrest rates within SMPD.

Using this data, (and even more i hope) I want to come up with a set of standard metrics that can check for implicit bias, and calculate incidents, arrests and convictions-- a funnel of criminal justice. My intent is do a deep dive and analysis of police data. Not to call any one out, but in a sincere attempt to make an easy way for police forces across the country to metric their effectiveness.
