## Data Science, Politics, and Police

this is an active work in progress

# BACKGROUND
The intersection of science, politics, personal opinion, and social policy can be rather complex.  This junction of ideas and disciplines is often rife with controversies, strongly held viewpoints, and agendas that are often [more based on belief than on empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy).  Data science is particularly important in this area since it provides a methodology for examining the world in a pragmatic fact-first manner, and is capable of providing insight into some of the most important issues that we face today.

High-profile police shootings killings of unarmed black men have triggered a divisive national dialog on the issue of racial bias in policing. These events, compounded with years of racial injustice have spurred the growth of large social movements seeking to raise awareness of what is viewed as the systemic targeting of people-of-color by police forces across the country.  On the other side of the spectrum, many hold a view that an unbalanced targeting of non-white citizens is a myth created by the media based on a handful of extreme cases, and that these highly-publicized stories are not representative of the national norm.

Lots of analysis has been done on this topic, but I wanted to look at it from a local perspective. 

# DATA

SMPD Publishes arrest lists daily (See: SMPD Media Arrest List & SMPD Incident List) Using these lists obtained through open records requests I will analyze and visualize this data using Python.

Fields I can compile from these reports:

* Incident #
* Arrest Date	
* Officer
* Location	
* Age
* Sex
* Race
* Officer

# GOAL
Something like:

# PROPS
Thanks for Patrick Triest for the inspiration, jump start, & tutorial. To read more about his original analysis, visit - https://blog.patricktriest.com/police-data-python/

## This notebook is 100% open-source, feel free to utilize the code however you would like.
