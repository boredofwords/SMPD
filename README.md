This junction of ideas and disciplines is often rife with controversies, strongly held viewpoints, and agendas that are often [more based on belief than on empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy).

These shootings have spurred the growth of large social movements seeking to raise awareness of what is viewed as the systemic targeting of people-of-color by police forces across the country.
